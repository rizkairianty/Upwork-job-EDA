# Upwork-job-EDA
An exploratory data analysis to find the characteristics of the jobs posted on Upwork.

## Background
Upwork is a freelancing platform that connects businesses with independent freelancers and professionals around the globe.
The platform offers variety of job services such as Design & Creative, Sales & Marketing, AI Services, etc.
To submit a proposal, freelancers need to spend some ‘Connects’. ‘Connects’ are like currency on the platform, allowing freelancers to submit proposals to clients for job opportunities. 
Clients can choose to use hourly rate scheme or fixed-price scheme. Clients can also leave the budget field empty so they can negotiate the fee with the freelancers via chat.

## Objectives

As a freelancer who’s been using the platform in the last two months, I made this analysis from a freelancer perspective. These are the questions that I sought to answer:
1. How many ‘Connects’ a job usually needs?
2. What job category is the most popular?
3. What is the average pay for a job?
4. Which country are the clients mostly came from?


## Main findings

Here are the conclusions and some recommendations for people who might just start your gig on Upwork:
1. Most jobs need 6 connects to submit a proposal, so make sure you have enough connects
2. Although Web, Mobile & Software Dev is the most in-demand job category, Sales & Accounting and Legal are the most high-paying jobs in the market.
3. Average hourly rate is $26.19 and average fixed-budget is $667.84. 
4. US, UK, and Canada are the top 3 client location
